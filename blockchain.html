                        Blockchain technology allows us to have currency 
                        that is completely decentralized
                        from the national bank and other private banks.
                        High transfer fees, technical issues, and maximum 
                        transfer limit can be avoided.

                        It is secured by a strong encryption algorithm that prevents

                        Crytocurrencies are immune to counterfeiting because each block 
                        is made so that only the owner of the block can change its data.
                        Each block also contains information of the previous blocks.
                        Ensuring that even if one block is tampered with, the new data 
                        has to match up with other blocks linked to the chain.
